# Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the product and engineering direction for `ragops-lab` as an
evaluation-first RAG and LLMOps platform. It is organised as: current state,
known issues and bugs, milestones, planned features, and near-term priorities.

## Current state

The repository includes a working local MVP with:

- typed domain models for documents, chunks, retrieval results, generated answers, evaluations, and traces
- reusable ingestion for text, markdown, csv, and optional pdf adapters
- lexical, vector, and hybrid retrieval flows
- grounded answer generation with citation validation and refusal handling
- evaluation metrics (context precision/recall, faithfulness, citation support, answer relevance, refusal correctness) and report export
- CLI commands for ingestion and question answering
- FastAPI endpoints for ingestion, retrieval, answering, evaluation, and trace lookup
- local trace persistence and a minimal dashboard
- an analytical notebook suite (retrieval tuning, strategy comparison, grounded generation, end-to-end evaluation) built on package code, committed with executed outputs and figures
- automated linting, type-checking, and test coverage (~90%)
- CI coverage across Python 3.11 and 3.12
- CI-backed deterministic RAG evaluation regression checks with persisted
  artifacts
- notebook execution checks in CI with `nbval`
- configurable runtime paths and API request safety limits
- trace summary, filtering, and dashboard inspection views
- persistent local vector indexing and reload support

## Recently completed

- Fixed default `FakeEmbeddingClient` behavior so document and query vectors
  share the same fitted vocabulary.
- Added validation for unsupported chunking strategies instead of silently
  ignoring `ChunkingConfig.strategy`.
- Added professional repository hygiene: license, contribution guide, security
  policy, pre-commit hooks, Docker build hygiene, and improved CI.
- Added a deterministic RAG evaluation regression gate with faithfulness and
  citation-support thresholds, JSON/CSV/Markdown artifacts, and CI artifact
  upload.
- Added notebook execution checks in CI with `nbval`.
- Added environment-backed runtime settings for data, artifact, chunk, trace,
  and model paths.
- Added API request-size, query-length, text-length, and `top_k` guards.
- Added structured API errors and clearer CLI exits for missing files,
  unsupported inputs, and invalid evaluation requests.
- Added trace summaries, a filtered `GET /traces` endpoint, and a richer
  dashboard table for trace inspection.
- Added a persistent local vector index with CLI/API build and reload flows.

## Known issues and bugs

These are confirmed defects with concrete reproduction paths. They should be
fixed before the behaviours they affect are relied on.

- **Chunking splits mid-word and mid-sentence.** Fixed-width character chunking
  cuts tokens in half at boundaries (e.g. `onstrain the model...`), which
  pollutes lexical term matches and embeddings near the seams. *Fix:* snap chunk
  boundaries to word or sentence limits.
- **`OverlapJudge` answer-relevance is a weak proxy.** It scores how many query
  terms reappear in the answer, which yields structurally low values and is not
  safe to use as a quality gate (only as a trend signal). *Fix:* add a
  model-based or embedding-based relevance judge behind the existing
  `RelevanceJudge` protocol.
- **Faithfulness uses lexical subset matching.** `unsupported_claim_count`
  flags a claim as unsupported unless its tokens are a strict subset of the
  evidence tokens, which is brittle to paraphrase and stopwords. *Fix:* move to
  claim-level entailment via embeddings or an LLM judge.

## Milestone 1 — Complete the evaluation pipeline

- [x] Add a dedicated CI job for regression-style RAG evaluation (the notebook
  04 gate logic, lifted into a runnable script).
- [x] Enforce failure thresholds for faithfulness and citation support.
- [x] Persist evaluation outputs to `artifacts/evaluation`.
- [x] Upload evaluation artifacts from CI for inspection.
- [x] Execute the notebooks in CI with `nbval` (already a dev dependency) so they
  cannot silently rot.
- [x] Add clearer reporting for retrieval metrics and answer-quality metrics.

## Milestone 2 — Strengthen runtime and API behavior

- [x] Add request-size and payload-size guards to the API surface.
- [x] Make runtime paths and storage locations configurable through environment settings.
- [x] Improve error responses and validation messages across API and CLI entrypoints.
- [x] Add better trace summaries, filtering, and inspection views in the dashboard.

## Milestone 3 — Move beyond in-memory retrieval

- [x] Add a persistent local vector store for embeddings.
- [x] Add indexing and reload flows for processed documents and chunks.
- Separate retrieval configuration from runtime execution paths.
- Support configurable retrieval profiles for lexical, vector, and hybrid search.

## Milestone 4 — Improve generation and evaluation depth

- Add provider-backed LLM and embedding integrations behind the existing
  abstractions (the `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingClient` adapter exists but is
  not wired into the CLI or API defaults).
- Add stronger claim extraction and evidence matching for faithfulness checks.
- Add dataset-oriented evaluation commands for repeated benchmark runs.
- Expand refusal evaluation for unanswerable and weak-context cases.

## Milestone 5 — Product and deployment polish

- Improve the dashboard into a more useful inspection surface for traces and metrics.
- Add richer API usage documentation and example payloads.
- Add release notes and a first tagged release from `main`.
- Add deployment guidance for local demos and portfolio presentation.

## Planned features

- **Reranking stage.** Add a cross-encoder reranker behind a `Reranker` protocol
  and a retrieve-then-rerank path, so the candidate set can be widened cheaply
  and reordered for precision.
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion.** Offer RRF as an alternative to weighted score
  fusion in `HybridRetriever`, removing the need to calibrate score scales.
- **Token- and sentence-aware chunking.** Implement the chunking strategies the
  config already advertises, with boundary snapping.
- **Model-as-judge evaluation.** Pluggable LLM judges for relevance and
  faithfulness, with the deterministic lexical judges kept as the offline path.
- **Cost and latency budgets.** Track token and latency distributions per
  request and fail evaluation when p95 budgets are breached, not just on quality.
- **Golden-set tooling.** A small command to (re)build the golden set by
  resolving answer phrases to current chunk ids, keeping fixtures in sync with
  the chunker.
- **Dataset versioning.** Record the chunking config and corpus hash alongside
  evaluation artifacts so results are reproducible and comparable across runs.

## Near-term priorities

1. Finish CI-backed evaluation regression checks and artifact publishing, and
   run the notebooks under `nbval` in CI.
2. Harden API safety limits and runtime configuration.
3. Add persistent retrieval storage instead of relying on in-memory indexing.
4. Wire real embedding and LLM providers into the CLI and API defaults behind
   the existing abstractions.
